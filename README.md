## 1. Project Overview

**Purpose:**  
EO AgriTool aims to address critical agricultural challenges by integrating data from diverse sources (satellites, UAVs, and ground sensors) and providing farmers with:
- **Real-time alerts** for weather extremes and crop health issues.
- **Custom reports** that deliver targeted insights to improve farm management.
- **Interactive maps** that visualize complex environmental data for on-the-ground decision-making.

**Target Audience:**  
Egyptian farmers and agricultural stakeholders seeking to enhance sustainability, improve crop yields, and ultimately reduce their environmental footprint.

**Problem Addressed:**  
Agriculture faces multiple adversities—including unpredictable weather, pest infestations, water scarcity, and soil degradation—that directly impact productivity and profitability. EO AgriTool confronts these issues by using data-driven insights and promoting regenerative agriculture methods to restore and maintain soil health, conserve water, and manage resources efficiently.
