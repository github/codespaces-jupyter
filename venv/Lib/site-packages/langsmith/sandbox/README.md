# LangSmith Sandbox

Sandboxed code execution for LangSmith. Run untrusted code safely in isolated containers.

## Quick Start

```python
from langsmith.sandbox import SandboxClient

# Client uses LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT and LANGSMITH_API_KEY from environment
client = SandboxClient()

# Create a sandbox with the default runtime and run code
with client.sandbox() as sb:
    result = sb.run("python -c 'print(2 + 2)'")
    print(result.stdout)  # "4\n"
    print(result.success)  # True

# Or create a sandbox to keep
sb = client.create_sandbox()
result = sb.run("python -c 'print(2 + 2)'")
client.delete_sandbox(sb.name)  # Don't forget to clean up when done

# Or use an existing sandbox by name
sb = client.get_sandbox(name="your-sandbox")
result = sb.run("python -c 'print(2 + 2)'")
```

Use a snapshot when you want to boot from a reusable custom filesystem image.

## Installation

The sandbox module works out of the box for basic command execution (HTTP). For
**real-time output** (streaming, callbacks, and `timeout=0`), install the
optional dependency:

```bash
pip install 'langsmith[sandbox]'
```

This pulls in the `websockets` package. Without it, `sb.run()` falls back to
HTTP automatically.

## Configuration

The client automatically uses LangSmith environment variables:

```python
from langsmith.sandbox import SandboxClient

# Uses LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT and LANGSMITH_API_KEY
client = SandboxClient()

# Or configure explicitly
client = SandboxClient(
    api_endpoint="https://api.smith.langchain.com/v2/sandboxes",
    api_key="your-api-key",
    timeout=30.0,
)
```

## Running Commands

```python
with client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id) as sb:
    # Run a command
    result = sb.run("echo 'Hello, World!'")

    print(result.stdout)     # "Hello, World!\n"
    print(result.stderr)     # ""
    print(result.exit_code)  # 0
    print(result.success)    # True

    # Commands that fail return non-zero exit codes
    result = sb.run("exit 1")
    print(result.success)    # False
    print(result.exit_code)  # 1
```

## Streaming Output

For long-running commands, you can stream output in real time. This requires
the `websockets` package (`pip install 'langsmith[sandbox]'`).

### Callbacks

The simplest way to get real-time output. Blocks until the command completes.

```python
import sys

with client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id) as sb:
    result = sb.run(
        "make build",
        timeout=600,
        on_stdout=lambda s: print(s, end=""),
        on_stderr=lambda s: print(s, end="", file=sys.stderr),
    )
    print(f"\nBuild {'succeeded' if result.success else 'failed'}")
```

### Streaming with CommandHandle

For full control — access to the process handle, stream identity, kill, and
reconnection.

```python
with client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id) as sb:
    handle = sb.run("make build", timeout=600, wait=False)

    print(f"Command ID: {handle.command_id}")

    for chunk in handle:
        prefix = "OUT" if chunk.stream == "stdout" else "ERR"
        print(f"[{prefix}] {chunk.data}", end="")

    result = handle.result
    print(f"\nExit code: {result.exit_code}")
```

### Killing a Running Command

```python
import threading
import time

with client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id) as sb:
    handle = sb.run("sleep 3600", timeout=7200, wait=False)

    # Kill after 10 seconds from another thread
    def kill_after(h, seconds):
        time.sleep(seconds)
        h.kill()

    threading.Thread(target=kill_after, args=(handle, 10)).start()

    for chunk in handle:
        print(chunk.data, end="")

    result = handle.result
    print(f"Exit code: {result.exit_code}")  # non-zero (killed)
```

### Sending Stdin Input

```python
with client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id) as sb:
    handle = sb.run(
        "python -c 'name = input(\"Name: \"); print(f\"Hello {name}\")'",
        timeout=30,
        wait=False,
    )

    for chunk in handle:
        if "Name:" in chunk.data:
            handle.send_input("World\n")
        print(chunk.data, end="")

    result = handle.result
```

### Auto-Reconnect

`CommandHandle` (returned by `sb.run(wait=False)`) automatically
reconnects on transient disconnects — hot-reloads, network blips, etc. No user
code needed:

```python
with client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id) as sb:
    handle = sb.run("make build", timeout=600, wait=False)

    # Auto-reconnects on transient errors (hot-reload, network blips)
    for chunk in handle:
        print(chunk.data, end="")

    result = handle.result
```

For manual reconnection across process restarts:

```python
with client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id) as sb:
    handle = sb.run("make build", timeout=600, wait=False)
    command_id = handle.command_id

    # ... later, possibly in a different process ...

    handle = sb.reconnect(command_id)
    for chunk in handle:
        print(chunk.data, end="")
    result = handle.result
```

### No Timeout (`timeout=0`)

With WebSocket enabled, you can set `timeout=0` to let a command run
indefinitely with no server-side deadline. This works with both `wait=False`
and callbacks. Useful for long-lived processes like dev servers, file watchers,
or background tasks that you control via `kill()`.

```python
with client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id) as sb:
    handle = sb.run("python server.py", timeout=0, wait=False)

    for chunk in handle:
        print(chunk.data, end="")
        if "Ready" in chunk.data:
            break  # server is up, do other work

    handle.kill()  # stop when done
```

> **Note:** `timeout=0` requires WebSocket support
> (`pip install 'langsmith[sandbox]'`). Without WebSocket, `run()` falls
> back to HTTP which has its own request-level timeout.

## Command Lifecycle & TTL

The sandbox daemon automatically manages command session lifecycles with two
timeout mechanisms:

### Session TTL (finished commands)

After a command finishes (exits), its session remains in memory for a TTL
period. During this window you can still reconnect to retrieve output. After the
TTL expires, the session is cleaned up and `reconnect()` will raise an error.

```python
with client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id) as sb:
    handle = sb.run("make build", wait=False)
    command_id = handle.command_id

    # Even after the command finishes, you can reconnect within the TTL window
    handle = sb.reconnect(command_id)
    result = handle.result
    print(result.stdout)

    # After TTL expires, reconnect raises SandboxOperationError
```

### Idle Timeout (running commands)

Running commands with no connected clients are killed after an idle timeout
(default: 5 minutes). The idle timer resets each time a client connects. This
prevents orphaned long-running processes from consuming resources indefinitely.

You can set a per-command idle timeout via the `idle_timeout` parameter.
Set to `-1` for no idle timeout (the command runs indefinitely until explicitly
killed or it exits on its own).

```python
with client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id) as sb:
    # Start a long-running command with a 30-minute idle timeout
    handle = sb.run(
        "python server.py",
        timeout=0,
        idle_timeout=1800,
        wait=False,
    )

    # As long as a client is connected (iterating), the idle timer is paused
    for chunk in handle:
        print(chunk.data, end="")
        if "Ready" in chunk.data:
            break

    # After disconnecting, the idle timer starts
    # If no client reconnects within idle_timeout seconds, the process is killed
```

### Kill on Disconnect

By default, commands continue running after a client disconnects and can be
reconnected to later. Set `kill_on_disconnect=True` to kill the command
immediately when the last client disconnects:

```python
with client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id) as sb:
    # Command is killed as soon as the client disconnects
    handle = sb.run(
        "python server.py",
        kill_on_disconnect=True,
        wait=False,
    )

    for chunk in handle:
        print(chunk.data, end="")
        if "Ready" in chunk.data:
            break
    # Command is killed here when iteration stops and the WS disconnects
```

### Combining Lifecycle Options

All lifecycle parameters can be combined:

```python
with client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id) as sb:
    # Long-running task: 30-min idle timeout, 1-hour session TTL
    handle = sb.run(
        "python train.py",
        timeout=0,              # No command timeout
        idle_timeout=1800,      # Kill after 30min with no clients
        ttl_seconds=3600,       # Keep session for 1 hour after exit
        wait=False,
    )

    # Fire-and-forget: no idle timeout, infinite TTL
    handle = sb.run(
        "python background_job.py",
        timeout=0,
        idle_timeout=-1,        # Never kill due to idle
        ttl_seconds=-1,         # Keep session forever
        wait=False,
    )
```

## PTY (Pseudo-Terminal)

Set `pty=True` to allocate a pseudo-terminal for the command. This is useful
for interactive programs and commands that detect terminal capabilities:

```python
with client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id) as sb:
    # Run an interactive Python REPL with PTY
    handle = sb.run("python", pty=True, wait=False)

    for chunk in handle:
        if ">>>" in chunk.data:
            handle.send_input("print('hello')\n")
            break

    for chunk in handle:
        if ">>>" in chunk.data:
            handle.send_input("exit()\n")
            break

    result = handle.result

    # Commands that require a TTY
    result = sb.run("top -b -n 1", pty=True)
```

> **Note:** PTY mode merges stdout and stderr into a single stream (stdout).
> Only use PTY when the command requires it — most commands work fine without it.

## File Operations

Read and write files in the sandbox:

```python
with client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id) as sb:
    # Write a file
    sb.write("/app/script.py", "print('Hello from file!')")

    # Run the script
    result = sb.run("python /app/script.py")
    print(result.stdout)  # "Hello from file!\n"

    # Read a file (returns bytes)
    content = sb.read("/app/script.py")
    print(content.decode())  # "print('Hello from file!')"

    # Write binary files
    sb.write("/app/data.bin", b"\x00\x01\x02\x03")
```

## TCP Tunnel

Access any TCP service running inside a sandbox (databases, Redis, HTTP servers,
etc.) as if it were running on your local machine. The tunnel opens a local TCP
port and forwards connections through a multiplexed WebSocket to the target port
inside the sandbox.

Requires the `websockets` package (`pip install 'langsmith[sandbox]'`).

### Basic Usage — PostgreSQL

Build a snapshot from the `postgres:16` image. The entrypoint initializes and
starts Postgres automatically:

```python
import psycopg2

postgres_snapshot = client.create_snapshot(
    "postgres-snapshot",
    docker_image="postgres:16",
    fs_capacity_bytes=4 * 1024**3,
)

sb = client.create_sandbox(snapshot_id=postgres_snapshot.id)
pg_handle = sb.run(
    "POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust docker-entrypoint.sh postgres",
    timeout=0,
    wait=False,
)
import time; time.sleep(6)  # wait for Postgres to initialize and start

try:
    with sb.tunnel(remote_port=5432, local_port=25432) as t:
        conn = psycopg2.connect(
            host="127.0.0.1",
            port=t.local_port,
            user="postgres",
        )
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute("SELECT version()")
        print(cursor.fetchone())
        conn.close()
finally:
    pg_handle.kill()
    client.delete_sandbox(sb.name)
```

### Basic Usage — Redis

Build a snapshot from the `redis:7` image. Redis self-daemonizes:

```python
import redis

redis_snapshot = client.create_snapshot(
    "redis-snapshot",
    docker_image="redis:7",
    fs_capacity_bytes=2 * 1024**3,
)

with client.sandbox(snapshot_id=redis_snapshot.id) as sb:
    sb.run("redis-server --daemonize yes", timeout=10)

    with sb.tunnel(remote_port=6379, local_port=26379) as t:
        r = redis.Redis(host="127.0.0.1", port=t.local_port)
        r.set("key", "value")
        print(r.get("key"))  # b"value"
```

### HTTP Services

Works with any TCP service. Start long-running services with `wait=False` and
`timeout=0` so they stay alive across commands:

```python
sb = client.create_sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id)
http_handle = sb.run("python3 -m http.server 3000", timeout=0, wait=False)
import time; time.sleep(2)

try:
    with sb.tunnel(remote_port=3000, local_port=13000) as t:
        import urllib.request
        resp = urllib.request.urlopen(f"http://127.0.0.1:{t.local_port}/")
        print(resp.status)  # 200
finally:
    http_handle.kill()
    client.delete_sandbox(sb.name)
```

### Multiple Tunnels

Open several tunnels simultaneously to different services:

```python
http_handle2 = sb.run("python3 -m http.server 3001", timeout=0, wait=False)
import time; time.sleep(1)

with sb.tunnel(remote_port=3000, local_port=23000) as t1, \
     sb.tunnel(remote_port=3001, local_port=23001) as t2:
    resp1 = urllib.request.urlopen(f"http://127.0.0.1:{t1.local_port}/")
    resp2 = urllib.request.urlopen(f"http://127.0.0.1:{t2.local_port}/")

http_handle2.kill()
```

### Explicit Lifecycle

For notebooks or long-lived sessions where a context manager isn't convenient:

```python
t = sb.tunnel(remote_port=3000, local_port=23002)

print(t.local_port)
# ... use the tunnel as long as needed ...

t.close()
```

### Async Usage

```python
async with await client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id) as sb:
    async with await sb.tunnel(remote_port=5432) as t:
        conn = await asyncpg.connect(host="127.0.0.1", port=t.local_port)
```

## Service URLs

Access HTTP services running inside a sandbox without opening a TCP tunnel.
`service()` returns a `ServiceURL` object with a short-lived JWT that
auto-refreshes transparently. Built-in HTTP helpers inject the auth header
for you.

### Basic Usage

```python
with client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id) as sb:
    # Start a web server inside the sandbox
    handle = sb.run("python -m http.server 3000", timeout=0, wait=False)
    import time; time.sleep(2)

    # Get a service URL for port 3000
    svc = sb.service(port=3000)

    # Make requests — token is injected automatically
    resp = svc.get("/")
    print(resp.status_code)  # 200

    # POST with JSON body
    resp = svc.post("/api/data", json={"key": "value"})

    # Access the raw token or URLs directly
    print(svc.token)        # JWT (auto-refreshes near expiry)
    print(svc.service_url)  # base URL for programmatic access
    print(svc.browser_url)  # URL that sets a cookie in a browser

    handle.kill()
```

### Custom Token TTL

Tokens default to 10 minutes. Set `expires_in_seconds` for longer or shorter
lifetimes (1 second to 24 hours):

```python
# Token valid for 1 hour
svc = sb.service(port=3000, expires_in_seconds=3600)
```

### Auto-Refresh

The `ServiceURL` object automatically refreshes its token before it expires.
You never need to worry about token rotation — just keep using the object:

```python
svc = sb.service(port=3000, expires_in_seconds=60)

# Even after 60 seconds, this still works — token refreshes transparently
resp = svc.get("/api/status")
```

### Async Usage

```python
async with await client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id) as sb:
    svc = await sb.service(port=3000)

    # Async HTTP helpers
    resp = await svc.get("/api/data")

    # Async accessors for auto-refreshing properties
    token = await svc.get_token()
    url = await svc.get_service_url()
```

## Snapshots

Snapshots are the starting point for every sandbox. They're built from Docker
images or captured from running sandboxes, and many sandboxes can share the
same snapshot.

### Build a Snapshot from a Docker Image

```python
from langsmith.sandbox import SandboxClient

client = SandboxClient()

# Build a snapshot — blocks until ready (default timeout=60s)
snapshot = client.create_snapshot(
    "my-python-env",
    docker_image="python:3.12-slim",
    fs_capacity_bytes=4 * 1024**3,  # 4 GB
)

# Optionally create a sandbox from the snapshot (by ID)
with client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot.id) as sb:
    result = sb.run("python --version")
    print(result.stdout)

# Or resolve by snapshot name. This is optional; omitting both snapshot_id and
# snapshot_name uses the default runtime.
with client.sandbox(snapshot_name="my-python-env") as sb:
    result = sb.run("python --version")
    print(result.stdout)
```

### Capture a Running Sandbox

Install packages or prepare files on a running sandbox, then capture the
result as a reusable snapshot. The returned snapshot has `source_sandbox_id`
set to the sandbox it was captured from, and can be used as the
`snapshot_id` for any later `create_sandbox` / `sandbox(...)` call.

```python
sb = client.create_sandbox(snapshot_id=base_snapshot_id, name="setup-box")
sb.run("pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn", timeout=180)
sb.write("/opt/config.yaml", "model: gpt-5\n")

# Either form works; the instance method just forwards to the client.
snapshot = sb.capture_snapshot("ml-ready", timeout=300)
# snapshot = client.capture_snapshot(sb.name, "ml-ready", timeout=300)
print(snapshot.id, snapshot.source_sandbox_id)

sb.delete()

# Later: spin up sandboxes from the captured snapshot
with client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot.id) as sb:
    sb.run("python -c 'import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)'")
    assert sb.read("/opt/config.yaml") == b"model: gpt-5\n"
```

> **Note:** `capture_snapshot` preserves only the **persistent filesystem**.
> Installed packages (under `/usr/local`, `/root`, `/opt`, the home
> directory, etc.) and files you wrote to those paths are kept. Running
> processes, open sockets, in-memory state, and anything under `/tmp`
> (which is a tmpfs) are **not** carried over — restart the processes you
> need in the new sandbox.

### Snapshot CRUD

```python
# List snapshots (server paginates with a default page size of 50)
snapshots = client.list_snapshots()

# Filter and paginate — all three kwargs are optional and independent.
# `limit` must be between 1 and 500 (inclusive); `offset` must be >= 0.
snapshots = client.list_snapshots(
    name_contains="python",  # case-insensitive substring match on name
    limit=100,
    offset=0,
)

# Get a snapshot by ID
snapshot = client.get_snapshot("550e8400-...")

# Delete a snapshot
client.delete_snapshot("550e8400-...")

# Build with longer timeout for large images
snapshot = client.create_snapshot(
    "heavy-image",
    docker_image="nvidia/cuda:12.0-devel-ubuntu22.04",
    fs_capacity_bytes=16 * 1024**3,
    timeout=600,
)
```

## Start / Stop

Snapshot-based sandboxes can be stopped and restarted. The sandbox files are
preserved across stop/start cycles.

```python
sb = client.create_sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot.id, name="my-vm")
sb.run("echo 'hello' > /tmp/state.txt")

# Stop the sandbox (preserves sandbox files)
sb.stop()

# Later: restart it
sb.start()  # blocks until ready (default timeout=120s)

result = sb.run("cat /tmp/state.txt")
assert result.stdout.strip() == "hello"
```

You can also use the client methods directly:

```python
client.stop_sandbox("my-vm")
sandbox = client.start_sandbox("my-vm")
```

## Sandbox Lifetime & TTL

Sandboxes follow a two-stage retention model anchored to **idle activity**
and the **`stopped`** state — there is no wall-clock "max lifetime" TTL:

- **`idle_ttl_seconds`** — Idle timeout. The launcher stops the sandbox
  after this many seconds of inactivity (any command execution or file I/O
  resets the timer). When omitted at creation, the server applies a default
  of `600` seconds (10 minutes); pass `0` explicitly to disable the idle
  stop and keep the sandbox running indefinitely.
- **`delete_after_stop_seconds`** — Stop-anchored deletion. Once a sandbox
  enters the `stopped` state (either via the idle timer above or an explicit
  `stop_sandbox` call), this timer starts. After the deadline passes, the
  sandbox row and its filesystem clone are permanently deleted by a
  server-side sweep. Pass `0` to disable stop-anchored deletion (manual
  cleanup required); when omitted, the server applies its configured default
  (typically 14 days).

Both values must be multiples of 60 (minute-resolution). The lifecycle is:

```
running ──(idle for idle_ttl_seconds)──▶ stopped ──(delete_after_stop_seconds)──▶ deleted
```

```python
# Default retention (server defaults: 10 min idle stop, 14 day delete)
with client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id) as sb:
    result = sb.run("echo hello")

# Aggressive: stop after 5 min idle, delete 1 hour after stop
sb = client.create_sandbox(
    snapshot_id=snapshot_id,
    idle_ttl_seconds=300,
    delete_after_stop_seconds=3600,
)

# Long-running: never auto-stop, delete 7 days after manual stop
sb = client.create_sandbox(
    snapshot_id=snapshot_id,
    idle_ttl_seconds=0,
    delete_after_stop_seconds=604800,
)

# Inspect retention settings
print(sb.idle_ttl_seconds)            # e.g. 300
print(sb.delete_after_stop_seconds)   # e.g. 3600
print(sb.stopped_at)                  # None while running, ISO timestamp once stopped
```

### Updating retention on existing sandboxes

You can update either retention setting on a running or stopped sandbox.
Updating `delete_after_stop_seconds` on an already-stopped sandbox shifts
its deletion deadline (`stopped_at + delete_after_stop_seconds`):

```python
# Extend the idle stop to 30 minutes
sb = client.update_sandbox("my-sandbox", idle_ttl_seconds=1800)

# Push the deletion deadline out to 30 days after stop
sb = client.update_sandbox("my-sandbox", delete_after_stop_seconds=2592000)

# Disable both — sandbox keeps running and never auto-deletes
sb = client.update_sandbox(
    "my-sandbox",
    idle_ttl_seconds=0,
    delete_after_stop_seconds=0,
)
```

> **Migration note:** the previous `ttl_seconds` (hard wall-clock
> TTL) and `expires_at` fields were removed. The hard TTL never reliably
> deleted stopped sandboxes; replace any usage with `idle_ttl_seconds` for
> stopping and `delete_after_stop_seconds` for deletion.

## Reusing Existing Sandboxes

Get a sandbox that's already running:

```python
# Create a sandbox (requires explicit cleanup)
sb = client.create_sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id)
print(sb.name)  # e.g., "sandbox-abc123"

# Later, get the same sandbox
sb = client.get_sandbox("sandbox-abc123")
result = sb.run("echo 'Still running!'")

# Clean up when done
client.delete_sandbox("sandbox-abc123")
```

## Async Sandbox Creation

By default, `create_sandbox()` blocks until the sandbox is ready. For
non-blocking creation, pass `wait_for_ready=False`:

```python
# Returns immediately with status="provisioning"
sb = client.create_sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id, wait_for_ready=False)
print(sb.status)  # "provisioning"

# Poll until ready using the lightweight status endpoint
sb = client.wait_for_sandbox(sb.name, timeout=120, poll_interval=1.0)
print(sb.status)  # "ready"

# Now the sandbox is usable
result = sb.run("echo hello")
```

You can also poll manually for more control:

```python
sb = client.create_sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id, wait_for_ready=False)

while True:
    status = client.get_sandbox_status(sb.name)
    if status.status == "ready":
        sb = client.get_sandbox(sb.name)
        break
    if status.status == "failed":
        print(f"Failed: {status.status_message}")
        break
    time.sleep(1)
```

> **Note:** Operations like `run()`, `write()`, and `read()` will raise
> `SandboxNotReadyError` if called on a sandbox that isn't ready yet.

## Async Support

Full async support for all operations:

```python
from langsmith.sandbox import AsyncSandboxClient

async def main():
    async with AsyncSandboxClient() as client:
        # Build a snapshot first
        snapshot = await client.create_snapshot(
            "async-python",
            docker_image="python:3.12-slim",
            fs_capacity_bytes=4 * 1024**3,
        )

        # Use the snapshot
        async with await client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot.id) as sb:
            result = await sb.run("python -c 'print(1 + 1)'")
            print(result.stdout)  # "2\n"

            await sb.write("/app/test.txt", "async content")
            content = await sb.read("/app/test.txt")
            print(content.decode())
```

### Async Streaming

```python
async with await client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id) as sb:
    handle = await sb.run("make build", timeout=600, wait=False)

    async for chunk in handle:
        print(chunk.data, end="")

    result = await handle.result
```

## Error Handling

The module provides type-based exceptions with a `resource_type` attribute for specific handling:

```python
from langsmith.sandbox import (
    SandboxClientError,       # Base exception for all sandbox errors
    ResourceCreationError,    # Resource provisioning failed (check resource_type, error_type)
    ResourceNotFoundError,    # Resource doesn't exist (check resource_type)
    ResourceTimeoutError,     # Operation timed out (check resource_type)
    SandboxNotReadyError,     # Sandbox not ready for operations yet
    SandboxConnectionError,   # Network/WebSocket error
    CommandTimeoutError,      # Command exceeded its timeout (extends SandboxOperationError)
    QuotaExceededError,       # Quota limit reached
    TunnelError,              # Base for tunnel errors
    TunnelPortNotAllowedError,       # Port blocked by daemon allowlist
    TunnelConnectionRefusedError,    # Nothing listening on remote port
    TunnelUnsupportedVersionError,   # Client/daemon protocol mismatch
)

try:
    with client.sandbox(snapshot_id=snapshot_id) as sb:
        result = sb.run("sleep 999", timeout=10)
except CommandTimeoutError as e:
    print(f"Command timed out: {e}")
except ResourceCreationError as e:
    print(f"{e.resource_type} creation failed: {e}")
except ResourceNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"{e.resource_type} not found: {e}")
except ResourceTimeoutError as e:
    print(f"Timeout waiting for {e.resource_type}: {e}")
except SandboxConnectionError as e:
    print(f"Connection error: {e}")
except SandboxClientError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```
