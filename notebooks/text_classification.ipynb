It involves experimenting with different hyperparameter values of an algorithm to find the combination that yields the best model performance on a validation set. This can be done using techniques like [grid search](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV), where all possible combinations are tried, or random search, where random combinations are tested.\n",

It optimizes hyperparameters by randomly sampling a specified number of combinations from a given range. Each combination is evaluated using [cross-validation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html), and the best performing set is selected. This method is more efficient than exhaustive searches, as it explores the hyperparameter space more quickly while still finding effective parameter settings.\n",

    "* [**Metric choice**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html): consider what is suitable for your task and model, as well as, what best reflects the requirements for the solution.\n",
    "  * For example, in a customer support chatbot, we might care about [precision and recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) equally and therefore F1 would be the optimal metric. Or it might be that precision is more important since we would rather transfer the request to a human when the bot is unsure. Then we could use a weighted F1 where precision is weighed higher.\n",
    "  * In some cases of binary classification, for example, it could be that we care about only the top N results with the highest prediction score, therefore we need to compute our metrics on this top set (it's called @k, for example, precision@k).\n",
    "  * Also, in some cases of binary classification, it's important that your true positive examples get a higher predicted score, then [ROC AUC score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score.html) is a suitable metric. In other cases, it might not be important and then accuracy, F1, precision, and recall could work better.\n",
    "  * Don't use [accuracy score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html) for imbalanced datasets since if your positive class is only 5% of the data, predicting all to be negative will give a 95% accuracy which seems high but is useless. Precision, recall, F1 would be better choices.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Validation set evaluation**: This is also a possibility, especially for non-standard cases when cross-validation is challenging to apply. Be careful not to overfit the validation set! Note that the validation set is different from a test set in this case. The data is split into 3 parts - training, validation, and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Test set evaluation**:\n",
    "  * The test set should not be used during data preprocessing, model training, or hyperparameter tuning to prevent data leakage and biasing the evaluation results.\n",
    "  * The purpose is to provide a final, unbiased evaluation of the model's performance.\n",
    "  * Be careful to make sure that the test set is representative of the real production data and that the way it was split is suitable for your task. The same considerations as for cross-validation exist here; time series data or not independently and identically distributed data need to be treated differently.\n",
    "  * Take note of the class imbalances in the test set compared to the production data. This can affect your metrics calculation reliability.\n",
    "  * Final evaluation is always best in the production setting (such as in an A/B test), since only that can show the real performance and impact of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "* [**Cross-validation**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html):\n",
    "  * Cross-validation works by splitting the training data into multiple subsets (folds). The model is trained on all of these subsets but one and is evaluated on this remaining one. This process is repeated several times (same as the number of folds), and the results are averaged.\n",
    "  * It is often used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection. By using multiple folds, it generally provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance compared to a single train-test split.\n",
    "  * Be careful with using cross-validation for time series data or data that is not independently and identically distributed (one row is not an independent entry, for example, the same user_id is present in the data multiple times). Use evaluation approaches suitable for your kind of task, such as [time series-aware validation splitting](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation-of-time-series-data) or [Grouped cross-validation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#group-cv).\n",
